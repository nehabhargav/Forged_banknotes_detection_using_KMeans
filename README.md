# Forged_banknotes_detection_using_KMeans

High speed automated counterfeit banknote detection with high accuracy is the need of the hour for most of the institutions right from central banks of countries to small mom and pop stores. With criminals trying to defraud gullible customers or insurgents from hostile countries trying to destabilize the economy of a target country, counterfeit notes may be employed as tools for the same.

Data Science is about extraction, preparation, analysis, visualization, and maintenance of information. It is a cross-disciplinary field which uses scientific methods and processes to draw insights from data. 
This project uses k mean clustering algorithm for classification of genuine and fake currency. 

Data science is a powerful tool used for training and testing of data. Here we train the system with various input images of fake and genuine notes. After completion of training we test any currency. KNN algorithm gives 100% accuracy.
This is a classification project, since the variable to be predicted is binary (fraudulent or legal).The goal here is to model the probability that a banknote is fraudulent, as a function of its features.
